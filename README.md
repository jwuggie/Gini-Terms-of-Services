We may update this privacy policy at any time without prior notice. By continuing to use Gini, you agree to the latest version, so we suggest checking it regularly to stay informed.

The owner of Gini aims to keep the bot secure, effective, and reliable. We may introduce new features or adjustments at any time and reserve the right to charge for specific services. If charges are applied, we’ll ensure you are fully informed of the costs before any fees are incurred.

You are prohibited from attempting to modify, decompile, or extract Gini’s source code, as well as from creating any derivative versions of the bot. All rights related to Gini, including trademarks and copyrights, remain with its owner.

Gini may receive updates from time to time to enhance functionality or improve security. Should we choose to terminate the bot’s services, we will notify users in advance.
